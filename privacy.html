          <p>In the event that we are involved in a merger or sale of any business assets, the personal information of our users may be disclosed to a potential buyer. In the event we are seeking investment the personal information of users might be disclosed to a potential investor. In these events, we will make reasonable attempts to ensure the buyer or potential investor will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and enters into a non disclosure agreement with us;</p>
