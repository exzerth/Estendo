          <h2>Marketing & Advertising</h2>
          <p>We love to communicate with our users and so, depending on your marketing preferences, we may use your personal information to send you marketing, including by email, SMS or post. Some of these messages may be tailored to you, based on your previous use of our sites.</p>

Where you see an ad on third party websites or social media, this may be because we have engaged the third party or social network to show ads to our users, or others who match the demographic profile of our users. In some cases, this may involve sharing your email address or other unique identifiers (such as a cookie ID) with the third party or social network so that they can identify you as one of our users and serve you with an advert.

          <p>With law enforcement or other governmental authorities, in response to a lawful request or court order;</p>
          <p>In the event that we are involved in a merger or sale of any business assets, the personal information of our users may be disclosed to a potential buyer. In the event we are seeking investment the personal information of users might be disclosed to a potential investor. In these events, we will make reasonable attempts to ensure the buyer or potential investor will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and enters into a non disclosure agreement with us;</p>
          <p>We also disclose aggregate data, which does not identify any user personally, including to third parties working in media, consumer research; and</p>
